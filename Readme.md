# Welcome to the LUREC LMDB System Repository

Introduction to the System
--------------------------
The purpose of the LMDB System is to provide an application where users can submit data recorded on LUREC's grounds.  This data falls in to four categories:

* Changes
* Collections
* Measurements
* Sightings

The inputted data provides information on known **parameters** and **organisms** on the LUREC grounds.  The recordings on plotted on a map of LUREC using a spatial database.

Tools
-----------------

The **LMDB System** was developed using two main tools:

* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)

Great tutorials can be found on those websites to supplement the information on this Readme.

Code

There are three main sections of the code:

* The LMDB (reference) section
* The data input section
* The reporting section
